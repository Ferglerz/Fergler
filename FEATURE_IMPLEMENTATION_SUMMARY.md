# Advanced Envelope Features Implementation Summary

## Overview
Replaced hardware character models with flexible, preset-based envelope and detection features. All character behaviors (1176, LA-2A, Fairchild, VCA, etc.) can now be recreated using general-purpose controls with an intuitive visual interface.

---

## New Features Implemented

### 1. **Multi-Stage Cascaded Release** ⭐
**Slider 36:** `multi_stage_release` (Off/On toggle)

**What it does:**
- Creates smooth, musical compression release by cascading 3 envelope followers
- **Stage timings** (hardcoded as multiples of base release time):
  - Stage 1: 1x release_ms (fast)
  - Stage 2: 3x release_ms (medium)
  - Stage 3: 10x release_ms (slow)
- Stages cascade into each other for natural, organic release curves

**Hardware equivalents:**
- LA-2A Optical: 2-stage (120ms/900ms ≈ 1x/7x)
- Fairchild 670: 3-stage (60ms/200ms/800ms ≈ 1x/3x/13x)

**Usage:**
- Toggle ON for vintage optical/tube-style smooth release
- Adjust main `release_ms` slider to scale all stages proportionally
- Example: `release_ms = 100` → stages become 100ms/300ms/1000ms

**Future expansion notes** (in code comments):
- Make stage multipliers user-adjustable
- Add stage blend/mix controls
- Support 2-5 stages instead of fixed 3
- Add per-stage curve controls

### 2. **GR-Depth Dependent Release Blend** 🎚️
**Slider 37:** `gr_blend_threshold_db` (1-24 dB)

**What it does:**
- Controls the crossover point between fast and slow release in level-dependent mode
- Previously hardcoded at 6dB, now user-adjustable
- When GR exceeds this threshold, release slows down for smoother behavior

**Visual UI:**
- **Yellow horizontal line** on the GR meter (right side)
- Only visible when `prog_release_mode = On` AND `prog_release_type = Level-Dependent` or `Hybrid`
- **Draggable:** Click and drag line up/down to adjust threshold
- Shows current value in dB next to the line

**How it works:**
- Compression below threshold → uses fast release
- Compression above threshold → blends toward slow release
- Creates gentle, program-adaptive release behavior

---

### 3. **Input-Level Dependent Release** 📊
**Slider 38:** `input_level_threshold_db` (-80 to 0 dB)  
**Slider 28:** Updated to include new `Input-Level` option

**What it does:**
- Release speed changes based on raw input signal level (not GR amount)
- VCA-style behavior: louder signals get slower release, quiet signals get faster release
- Different from level-dependent: uses input amplitude, not compression depth

**Visual UI:**
- **Cyan/blue horizontal line** across the compression graph
- Only visible when `prog_release_mode = On` AND `prog_release_type = Input-Level`
- **Draggable:** Click and drag line up/down
- Label shows "Input: X.X dB"

**How it works:**
- Signals above threshold → slow release (prevents pumping on loud material)
- Signals below threshold → fast release (adds punch to quiet material)
- Automatically enforced 6dB minimum spacing from transient threshold

---

### 4. **Transient Detection (1176-Style)** 🎸
**Slider 39:** `transient_detection` (0-100, where 0=Off, 100=12dB max recovery)  
**Slider 40:** `transient_threshold_db` (-80 to 0 dB)

**What it does:**
- Detects rapid level increases and temporarily REDUCES compression
- Lets transients punch through, creating aggressive, punchy compression
- **This is NOT attack time** - it's dynamic attack based on signal content

**Visual UI:**
- **Red/orange horizontal line** across the compression graph
- Visible whenever `transient_detection > 0`
- **Draggable:** Click and drag line up/down to adjust threshold
- Label shows "Transient: X.X dB"
- Can be active simultaneously with input level line (different colors)

**How it works:**
1. Monitors rate of level increase per sample
2. When level rises rapidly AND exceeds threshold → transient detected
3. Temporarily reduces GR by up to 12dB (based on slider value)
4. Amount scales with how far above threshold signal goes

**Usage example:**
- `transient_detection = 50` → up to 6dB GR reduction on transients
- `transient_detection = 100` → up to 12dB GR reduction (maximum punch)
- `transient_threshold_db = -10` → only signals above -10dB trigger detection

**Why this is special:**
- Normal attack: applies compression slower
- Transient detection: **removes compression** on fast transients
- Creates the "snap" and "bite" of aggressive FET compressors like 1176

## Threshold Line Interaction System

### **Visual Feedback:**
- **Yellow line:** GR blend threshold (on meter)
- **Cyan line:** Input level threshold (on graph)
- **Red/orange line:** Transient threshold (on graph)

### **Interaction:**
1. Lines appear automatically when their feature is active
2. **Hover:** Line brightens to show it's interactive
3. **Click and drag:** Move line up/down to adjust threshold
4. **Spacing enforcement:** Lines automatically maintain 6dB minimum separation
5. **Real-time updates:** Parameter values update as you drag

### **Mouse cursor behavior:**
- Lines have 8-pixel grab radius for easy interaction
- When dragging, line follows mouse Y position
- Values clamp to valid ranges automatically

## Character Model Replacement Strategy

### **Old Approach:** Hardcoded character types
- Varimu, VCA, FET, Optical, etc. as dropdown menu
- Fixed behaviors for each type
- ~100 lines of nested conditionals
- Difficult to customize or combine behaviors

### **New Approach:** Flexible parameter-based presets
- All behaviors achievable through general controls
- Visual, interactive threshold adjustment
- Can mix and match features (e.g., transient detection + multi-stage release)
- Clean, modular code structure

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Multi-stage release:**
   - Try on sustained material (pads, vocals)
   - Compare with/without to hear smoothness difference
   - Test with different release_ms values

2. **GR blend threshold:**
   - Use on material with varying dynamics
   - Watch GR meter and line position during playback
   - Adjust threshold to control release response

3. **Input-level dependent:**
   - Test on drums/percussion with varying velocities
   - Adjust threshold to control where release changes
   - Compare with level-dependent mode

4. **Transient detection:**
   - Essential for drums and percussive material
   - Start with threshold around -10dB, amount around 50
   - Increase amount for more "snap" and attack
   - Watch how it interacts with compression curve

5. **Combined features:**
   - Try transient detection + multi-stage release
   - Use input-level mode with transient detection
   - Create custom presets combining multiple features

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### **Current Limitations:**
- Multi-stage ratios are hardcoded (1x/3x/10x)
- Threshold lines require manual dragging (no numeric input yet)
- No preset save/load system (coming soon)

### **Planned Enhancements:**
(Comments left in code for future development)
- Adjustable stage multipliers
- 2-5 stage support (not just 3)
- Per-stage curve controls
- Preset management system
- MIDI learn for threshold lines
