I would like to add a histogram of gain reduction or addition with a three second window, that renders as a line for gain reduction at the top of the graph and another line for gain reduction at the very bottom of the graph Their height will correlate with the height of the gain reduction and addition meters, the orange and blue, within the metre to the right of the graph Add a constant to enable and disable this feature
Edit

I'll help you add a histogram feature for gain reduction/addition. This will create visual bars at the top and bottom of the graph that track the GR history over a 3-second window.
Here's the implementation:
1. First, add the configuration constant to 01e_ui_config.jsfx-inc:
Untitled
Text 
// UI Configuration Module // UI constants, configuration, and layout definitions // Foundation for the modular UI library system - no dependencies @init //============================================================================== // UI CONFIGU
2. Add histogram state and memory allocation to 01b_state.jsfx-inc:
Untitled
Text 
// Display state current_input_db = GRAPH_MIN_DB; current_gr_db = 0; // Histogram state histogram_buffer = 0; // Will be allocated in memory histogram_max_samples = 0; histogram_pos = 0; histogram_initialized = 0;
3. Add histogram memory allocation to 01a_memory.jsfx-inc:
Untitled
Text 
function allocate_memory() ( // Set up graph points memory location (must be done first) !graph_points ? graph_points = GRAPH_POINTS_START; // Always allocate audio buffers (these can be reallocated safely) freemem = AUDIO_BUFFERS_START; //
4. Add histogram update function to 05e_ui_graph.jsfx-inc:
Untitled
Text 
//============================================================================== // GRAPHICS RENDERING //============================================================================== function update_histogram() ( // Store current GR value in circ
5. Update the rendering function to include histogram drawing:
Untitled
Text ∙ Version 2 
function render_complete_interface() local(has_any_curves, i) ( // Set background color gfx_clear = 0x202020; // Draw all interface elements in order draw_graph_background(); // Draw histogram before other graph elements draw_histogra
6. Finally, update the @sample section in Composure_Modular.jsfx to update the histogram:
Untitled
Text 
// Store feedback signals for next sample (for feedback detection mode) feedback_l_prev = final_l; feedback_r_prev = final_r; // Update histogram with current GR value update_histogram(); );
Summary
I've added a histogram feature that shows:
	1	Orange bars at the top of the graph - Show gain reduction history (negative GR values)
	2	Blue bars at the bottom of the graph - Show gain addition history (positive GR values)
Key Features:
	•	3-second window: The histogram tracks the last 3 seconds of gain reduction/addition
	•	Matches meter colors: Orange for reduction (matching the meter), blue for addition
	•	Enable/disable constant: Set HISTOGRAM_ENABLED = 0 in 01e_ui_config.jsfx-inc to disable
	•	Scales with meter: The bar heights correlate with the ±40dB range of the gain reduction meter
	•	Maximum 20 pixels height: Bars won't exceed 20 pixels to keep the graph readable
	•	Semi-transparent: Uses 60% opacity so you can still see the graph elements underneath
To Disable:
Simply change this line in 01e_ui_config.jsfx-inc:


javascript
HISTOGRAM_ENABLED = 0;  // Set to 0 to disable histogram
The histogram is drawn before the grid and compression curves, so it appears as a background element, and it uses the same color scheme as your gain reduction meter for visual consistency.

I'll help you add a histogram feature that renders as lines (not bars) at the top and bottom of the graph, showing the history of gain reduction/addition over a 3-second window.
Here's the implementation:
1. Add configuration constant to 01e_ui_config.jsfx-inc:
Untitled
Text ∙ Version 2 
// Visual configuration GFX_WIDTH = 3500; GFX_HEIGHT = 450; // Histogram configuration HISTOGRAM_ENABLED = 1; // Set to 0 to disable histogram HISTOGRAM_WINDOW_SECONDS = 3; // 3-second window for history HISTOGRAM_MAX_HEIGHT = 20; // Maximum he
2. Update the histogram drawing function to render as connected lines:

function draw_histogram() local(i, sample_idx, gr_value, x_pos, y_pos, samples_to_draw, meter_range_db, pixels_per_sample, prev_x, prev_y, first_point) ( HISTOGRAM_ENABLED && histogram_initialized ? ( meter_range_db = 40; // Match the meter ra
Perfect! Now the histogram renders as continuous lines instead of vertical bars. Here's what I've implemented:
Features:
	1	Orange line at the top - Shows gain reduction history (negative GR values), growing downward from the top edge of the graph
	2	Blue line at the bottom - Shows gain addition history (positive GR values), growing upward from the bottom edge of the graph
Key Improvements:
	•	Connected line rendering: Uses gfx_lineto() to draw smooth, antialiased lines connecting each sample point
	•	Proper history ordering: Samples are read from oldest to newest (left to right across the graph)
	•	Discontinuous line handling: When the compressor switches between reduction and no reduction (or addition and no addition), the line starts fresh rather than connecting across the gap
	•	Configurable max height: Set HISTOGRAM_MAX_HEIGHT to control how tall the lines can grow (default 20 pixels)
	•	Matches meter range: Uses the same ±40dB range as the gain reduction meter
	•	Enable/disable toggle: Set HISTOGRAM_ENABLED = 0 to disable
Visualization:

Check for dependency issues and how this is implemented, there are no forward declarations allowed
Edit

You're absolutely right! Let me check the dependency chain and fix any issues with forward references.
Looking at the implementation, I see the problem: 05e_ui_graph.jsfx-inc is calling update_histogram() in the render_complete_interface() function, but update_histogram() is defined in the same file. However, more critically, update_histogram() is being called from the @sample section in the main file, which happens before @gfx where the UI functions are available.
Let me fix this by moving the histogram update logic to a more appropriate location:
1. Move histogram update to 01b_state.jsfx-inc (state management):
Untitled
Text ∙ Version 2 
function reset_ui_state() ( // Reset UI interaction state ui_mouse_down = 0; ui_drag_control = -1; ui_mouse_x_prev = 0; ui_mouse_y_prev = 0; // Reset graph interaction state selected_point = -1; hovered_point = -1; mouse_down = 0
2. Remove the update_histogram() function from 05e_ui_graph.jsfx-incand keep only the drawing:
Untitled
Text ∙ Version 4 
//============================================================================== // GRAPHICS RENDERING //============================================================================== function draw_histogram() local(i, sample_idx, gr_value, x_pos, y
3. Update the main file to call the correctly placed function:
Untitled
Text ∙ Version 2 
// Store feedback signals for next sample (for feedback detection mode) feedback_l_prev = final_l; feedback_r_prev = final_r; // Update histogram state with current GR value (only if histogram is enabled) HISTOGRAM_ENABLED ? update_histogram_state(c
4. Verify the dependency chain is correct in the module imports:
Let me check the import order in the main file. The current order should be:


javascript
// Phase 0-1: Foundation
import 01a_memory.jsfx-inc       // No dependencies
import 01b_state.jsfx-inc        // Depends on: 02a_math_utils

// Audio processing
import 04a_compression_core.jsfx-inc // Depends on: 02a, 02b, 03a
// ... other 04* modules

// UI modules
import 05a_ui_core.jsfx-inc      // Depends on: 01e
import 05b_ui_controls.jsfx-inc  // No additional dependencies
import 05c_ui_rendering.jsfx-inc // Depends on: 02d

The issue is that 01b_state.jsfx-inc needs HISTOGRAM_ENABLED which is defined in 01e_ui_config.jsfx-inc. Let me fix this:
Untitled
Text ∙ Version 3 
// State Management Module // State variable initialization and management // Depends on: 02a_math_utils.jsfx-inc (for constants) @init
Now let's verify the dependency documentation in 05e_ui_graph.jsfx-inc:
Untitled
Text ∙ Version 5 
// UI Graph Module // Handles graph display, compression curves, level indicators, gain reduction meter, // histogram visualization, and interactive visual elements for the compression curve graph // Depends on: 01b_state.jsfx-inc, 01d_ui_interaction
Perfect! Now let me verify the complete dependency chain:
Dependency Summary:
Data Flow:
	1	@sample section → update_histogram_state() stores GR value in buffer (Phase 1: State Management)
	2	@gfx section → draw_histogram() reads from buffer and renders (Phase 5: UI Rendering)
Module Dependencies:
	•	01e_ui_config.jsfx-inc (Phase 1e) - Defines HISTOGRAM_ENABLED constant
	•	01b_state.jsfx-inc (Phase 1b) - Contains histogram state variables and update_histogram_state() function
	•	05e_ui_graph.jsfx-inc (Phase 5e) - Contains draw_histogram() rendering function
	•	Main file checks HISTOGRAM_ENABLED before calling update_histogram_state()
No Forward References:
	•	✅ update_histogram_state() is defined in Phase 1b (state management)
	•	✅ draw_histogram() is defined in Phase 5e (UI rendering)
	•	✅ Main file's @sample calls Phase 1b function
	•	✅ Main file's @gfx calls Phase 5e function
	•	✅ All constants are defined before use
The implementation is now properly structured with no forward declarations!

For efficiency, both the gain reduction and the histogram only need to calculate their position during the block code, not the sample block Is this easy enough to convert to from our existing system?
Edit

Excellent point! Yes, this is very easy to convert. We can move the histogram update to @block and use current_gr_dbwhich is already being tracked. Let me make this change:
1. Update the main file to move histogram update from @sample to @block:
Untitled
Text ∙ Version 3 
//============================================================================== // ON SLIDER UPDATES //============================================================================== @slider // Update filter coefficients update_filter_coefficients(
2. Remove the histogram update from @sample:
Untitled
Text ∙ Version 4 
// Store feedback signals for next sample (for feedback detection mode) feedback_l_prev = final_l; feedback_r_prev = final_r; );
Perfect! Now the histogram updates once per block instead of once per sample. Here's what changed:
Benefits of this approach:
	1	Much more efficient: Instead of updating the histogram ~48,000 times per second (at 48kHz), it now updates ~375-750 times per second (depending on block size of 64-128 samples)
	2	Still very accurate: With typical block sizes of 64-128 samples, you're still getting 375-750 histogram updates per second, which is more than enough temporal resolution for visualizing a 3-second window
	3	Uses existing state: current_gr_db is already being tracked and updated in the @sample section, so the @blocksection simply reads the latest value
	4	Simpler code: The histogram update is now in one logical place (@block) rather than being scattered through the sample processing
How it works:
	•	@sample section: Processes audio and updates current_gr_db on every sample (as it already does)
	•	@block section: Reads the current current_gr_db value once per block and stores it in the histogram buffer
	•	@gfx section: Draws the histogram from the buffer (unchanged)
The histogram will show slightly coarser temporal resolution (block-rate instead of sample-rate), but this is actually preferable because:
	•	It's visually indistinguishable (you can't see the difference between 375 updates/sec and 48,000 updates/sec on a display)
	•	It matches how the gain reduction meter already works
	•	It's far more CPU-efficient
The conversion was very easy because the architecture was already well-designed with current_gr_db as a tracked state variable!

Does that actually fix anything, or were we already simply grabbing an existing variable at the GFX frame rate?
Edit

You're absolutely right! I need to think about this more carefully.
Looking at the code flow:
	1	@sample section - runs 48,000 times/second, updates current_gr_db each time
	2	@block section - runs 375-750 times/second, we just added histogram update here
	3	@gfx section - runs at screen refresh rate (~60 times/second), calls draw_histogram() which just reads from the buffer
The issue is: we were already only drawing at GFX frame rate, but now we're writing to the histogram buffer at block rate (375-750 times/sec), which is still way more frequent than we need.
The real question is: what do we want?
Option A: High temporal resolution (current implementation)
	•	Update histogram at block rate (375-750 Hz)
	•	Captures very detailed GR history
	•	Uses more CPU and memory writes
Option B: Display-matched resolution (more efficient)
	•	Only update histogram at GFX rate (~60 Hz)
	•	Still captures plenty of detail for a 3-second window (180 samples)
	•	Much more efficient
If we want Option B (truly efficient), we should move the histogram update to @gfx:
Untitled
Text ∙ Version 5 
// Set plugin delay compensation lookahead_samples > 0 ? ( pdc_delay = lookahead_samples; pdc_bot_ch = 0; pdc_top_ch = num_ch; ) : ( pdc_delay = 0; ); //============================================================================== // GFX RU
You were correct to question this!
The original implementation was already efficient in the sense that we were only reading the histogram buffer at GFX rate. But we were writing to it unnecessarily frequently.
Now with the update in @gfx:
	•	Before: Writing to histogram at sample rate (48,000/sec), reading at GFX rate (60/sec) = wasteful
	•	After my first fix: Writing at block rate (375-750/sec), reading at GFX rate (60/sec) = better but still wasteful
	•	Now: Writing at GFX rate (60/sec), reading at GFX rate (60/sec) = perfectly matched!
With a 3-second window at 60 Hz, you get 180 data points, which is more than enough resolution to see the GR history clearly. The line will still look smooth and you've eliminated hundreds of unnecessary buffer writes per second.

I agree, let’s revert back to doing it in GFX
Edit

Perfect! The change is already done - I moved the histogram update from @block back to @gfx in my last update.
To summarize what we have now:


javascript
@gfx 3500 450

// Update histogram at display rate (most efficient)
HISTOGRAM_ENABLED ? update_histogram_state(current_gr_db);

// Render the main interface first
render_complete_interface();
This is the most efficient approach because:
	1	Matched rates: We write to the histogram buffer at the same rate we read from it (~60 Hz)
	2	No wasted work: We're not storing data more frequently than we can display it
	3	Sufficient resolution: 180 samples over 3 seconds (60 Hz × 3 sec) provides smooth, detailed visualization
	4	Minimal CPU impact: Only ~60 histogram updates per second instead of 375-48,000
The histogram will accurately show the gain reduction/addition history with a clean, smooth line that updates in sync with the visual display.
